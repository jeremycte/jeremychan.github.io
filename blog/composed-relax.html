          Recently, a close cousin of mine visited Singapore for the very first time for a week.
          As it was her first time in SG, I wanted to make the best out of it.
          One of the places, I brought my cousin was the Art Science Museum, the Future World Exhibition. B
          eing in this place brought a sense of awe and wonder. It showed me a sense of calmness and serenity in the midst of all my busyness.
          Even though being in the exhibition more than once, it allowed me to drop my worries and pressure amidst my submissions and exams.
          Entering the exhibition gave me a sense of fulfillment and rest.
          In the same way, we know although we have our work and daily schedule that we have to keep up to,
          don't let it hinder you from getting rest. Create a habit to find time for rest and to rejuvenate yourself from time to time.
          Surround yourself with friends, family and relatives.
          During this time of rest, build relationships and strengthen bonds.
        </p>

        <p class="lead text-center">
          Rest when you're weary. Refresh and renew yourself, your body, your mind, your spirit. Then get back to work. - Ralph Marston

        <p>
          I came across this book called Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.
          This book describe how we as an individual to identify the things of
          distraction and addiction. Mastering the art of self-control and
          being a minimalist. The word minimalism or minimalist sounds
          mainstream and over diluted in our society, but as a matter of fact,
          "minimalism" is about our mindset. It's never about owning only a
          few pieces of clothing or a tiny house with nothing but a mattress
          and zero waste. It's not about that friend of your that likes to
          wear clean and simplistic clothes or own a Macbook Air. It's about
          living with intention and make room and time for things that matters
          to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a person who requires myself to use a laptop and a phone to stay
          connected and able to do my work, I might sound like a hypocrite by
          saying we should use less of technology and learn to have more
          meaningful relationships regardless of where and when we are. But
          digital minimalism is not about deleting or rejecting the wonders of
          the internet but to reject the way we're engaged in it. Cal Newport
          described it so beautifully on what digital minimalism is all about.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p style="color:#000">
            Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of
            the internet age, but instead reject the way so many people
            currently engage with these tools

        <h3>30 Day Challenge</h3>

        <p>
          In around mid of June 2019, I took up the challenge of
          quitting/fasting from Social Media for 30 days. I was a challenging
          feat as I was extremely addicted to social media. On average, I was
          spending 1 hour of Instagram, min of 3 hours of YouTube daily. My
          definition of social media includes Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat
          and YouTube. During the 30 days, my experience of not using social
          media opened up my eyes to the amount of time I had gained by not
          using social media.I gained a total of 4 extra hours per day during
          my 30 day challenge. In the pursuit of knowledge, I decided to read
          more books during my fasting. Within one month, I was able to
          complete 2 books in just 30 days. A feat that I've never ever
          accomplish before! For some context, it would normally on average
          takes me 1 1/2 month to 2 months for me to completely read finish a
          books. In a nutshell, this 30 day challenge opened up my eyes to the
          possibility of exploring and creating new habits, from exercising,
          building a healthy sleep routine, intentionally catching up with
          friends and improving my reading.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes, some might say, all of this can be done without the challenge
          but what's to stop up from changing our old habits and diving into
          the unknown and trying out new things? This challenge is not to
          prove that we can't do anything productive without it but to show
          that we need a chance of status quo to shake things up. Below was
          the first video that challenged me and forced me to get out of my
          comfort zone and try something different. You should definitively
          check it out.

        <p>
          Digital Minimalism exists in many form, from using your computer
          intentionally to having a better phone experience. We all have a
          choice, to either ignore it or start afresh by regaining control of
          our lives and be intentional with the use of our technology. Let's
          start becoming intentional with what we choose to do and own and how
          it impacts our way of living and thinking about life 😉
